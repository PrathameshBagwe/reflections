How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Only viewing the difference simply reduced he amount of time it takes to find the bug. This method is very efficient.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    In case i get an error after making some changes that werent there before will sava a lot of time finding the error.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Google docs would make too many versions of my file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So that we can view what changes are made that affects all three files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
     
    Git log is used to list various versions of a file.
    Git diff i used to view the difference between files on mac and linux platforms.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   Even if i make a change which badly affects the system, i can just simply restore it with a previous one.
   This way i can easily do trail and error.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will be using it in most of my projects.
