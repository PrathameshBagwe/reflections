When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     In order to share ur work and also keeping it safe foem hazards and to use it from another system

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	 We might want to keep changes to ourselves before we share it in public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
     Fork copies a repository form one github account to another
     Clones are copies of a local repository or from a repository from github to our local account
     Branches are those that are created when we want to try out a version. They do not exist on the master branch commits but are a part of the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
     U can later compare the local master with it for any changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
     Each time one of us made any changes to a code, we would have to sit down and go through each and every line of the cde manually. Git or gitHub is easier.

 When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
     Creating a new brance lets u test a feature without affecting the original code. By doing so, we can later merge the changes if wanted.
