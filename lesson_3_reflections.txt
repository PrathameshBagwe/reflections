When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     In order to share ur work and also keeping it safe foem hazards and to use it from another system

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	 We might want to keep changes to ourselves before we share it in public.
